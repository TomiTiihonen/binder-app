## Frequently Asked Questions

**Where is my data stored?**
Your journal entries are stored on your device and synced to your personal iCloud account if iCloud is enabled in your iPhone settings. We never see your data.

**How do I restore my journal after reinstalling?**
As long as you're signed into the same iCloud account, your entries will restore automatically after reinstalling the app.

**Can I export my journal?**
Export options are on the roadmap. Check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/TomiTiihonen/binder-app/issues) for the latest status.

**How do I delete an entry?**
Swipe left on any entry in the journal list to reveal the delete option.

**The app is asking for microphone/photo access — why?**
Microphone access is needed for voice memos. Photo access is needed to attach photos to entries. Both are optional — you can decline and the rest of the app works normally.
