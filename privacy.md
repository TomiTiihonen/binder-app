description: Privacy policy for Binder - Journal & Notes
---

*Last updated: February 2026*

## Overview

Binder ("the app") is designed with your privacy in mind. Your journal entries are yours alone.

## Data We Collect

**We collect no personal data.**

The app does not include any analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking of any kind. We have no servers and no database of user information.

## Your Journal Data

All journal entries — including text, photos, audio recordings, and location information — are stored **locally on your device** and, if you have iCloud enabled, synced through your personal iCloud account.

- Your data is stored in iCloud under your own Apple ID
- Apple's iCloud infrastructure handles encryption in transit and at rest
- We have no access to your journal content at any time

## Location Data

If you choose to add a location to a journal entry, that location data is stored only within the entry itself on your device and iCloud. Location is never transmitted to us or any third party.

## Microphone & Photos

The app requests access to your microphone (for voice memos) and photo library (for photo attachments) only when you use those features. This data stays on your device and in your iCloud account.

## Children's Privacy

The app is not directed at children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect data from children.

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this policy, the new version will be posted here with an updated date.
